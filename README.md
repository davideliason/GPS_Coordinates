### Description

using MongoDB Atlas as cloud hosted DB, express on node.js, react/redux front-end

### Steps
This has been a real learning experience. Bottlenecks working at more abstract levels had me going back to basics, looking at node.js and express foundational levels and building upon that.

In doing so, I started with making sure that the express app was using security best practices by using helmet.js, using Snyk testing of modules, and being more aware of the issues as I move forward.
